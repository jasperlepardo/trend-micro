idea-body: I believe a very powerful enhancement to the Salesforce1 platform could be to give admins a new feature that allows for some automation on the creation and population of changesets for specific users.   Here is what I mean.  Let's say we have a new checkbox on the user detail page that says "Automatic Changeset" that, when clicked would put that user (admins only) in some sort of debug type state.  In that state any changes to the metadata for supported types by that user would be

Let's say we have a new checkbox on the user detail page that says "Automatic Changeset" that, when clicked would put that user (admins only) in some sort of debug type state.  In that state any changes to the metadata for supported types by that user would be sent to a changeset that is only deployable once that user is no longer in the debug state.  The changeset doesn't even need to be kept in sync.  Even a dumb dump on create and edit would be good enough.

  One of the huge advantages of using Salesforce is the speed at which we can deliver.  A big chunk of delivering is documenting the changes and building changesets for any solution delivery.  Not to mention how much a pain the changeset UI is at times L.  I am a huge changeset advocate and even I have to admit that the changeset editor hurts my soul!  If we could reduce delivery time by a noticeable margin then apps will be built faster and business solutions can be patched faster.  Leading to a happy Salesforce and a Happy Customer!
