idea-title: Merge Opportunity Records
idea-body: Ability to locate and merge duplicate Opportunity records. My users sometimes create 2 Opportunities on 1 Account record by mistake. I currently right now must delete one of the two Opportunity records where I chance losing valid information/notes/etc. This also at times alters the opportunity record's age (if I'm deleting the oldest of the two)
