    <h2 class="section-title display-3">Setting up product profiles for case submission</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section-body">
    <p>
      A product profile is an auto-complete tool for submitting product cases. It is a saved record of the production environment where your Trend Micro products are active.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-placeholder.png" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is advisable to set up all your product profiles for faster case submission. Selecting a product profile in the New Request form fills out the product, product version, product language and operating system information, so that there’s no need to select repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set up your product profile:
    </p>
    <ul class="list list-number list-indent list-nospace">
      <li>Sign in to the Support Portal. Or if you are logged in but in eSupport, click My Support from the header navigation.</li>
      <li>Hover over the Profile Menu on the top right of the page.</li>
      <li>Click My Products and Services.</li>
      <li>Click the Add New button in the “Product Profiles” table.</li>
      <li>The Create a Product Profile form is displayed. Fill out all required fields.</li>
      <li>Click the Submit button to save the record.</li>
